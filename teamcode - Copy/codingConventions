In this file I will go over some of the common coding conventions that are used in Java.

Comments:

//Single-line comment - generally used for commenting variables or a specific line of code

/*
 * Multi-line comment - generally used to comment on a small section of code
 */

/**
 * Javadoc comment - These comments are the documentation that you read in an API. Generally, you
 *  you want to have a javadoc before every class and before every function in the class. The
 *  only exceptions might be any getters and setters, since we all know what those do.
 *
 * This type of documentation will usually have some tags on it like the following:
 *
 * @author Corbin Young
 *
 * @param someParameter - this is generated for functions (including Constructors) that have parameters
 *
 * @return someObject - this is generated for a function that returns something (int, double, etc.)
 *
 * @throws SomeException - this is generated for a function that throws an exception
 *
 * Make sure you don't just give the name of an item for a tag, like someParameter. Make sure
 *  that you give a comment about it as well. The only one that doesn't require this is @author
 *
 * Also, the comments for a javadoc should could before any and all tags. Tags are the last thing
 *  in a javadoc.
 *
 * When you create a javadoc, Java will generate the tags for you. They are generated in the
 *  following order: param, return, throws. The author tag should only be put in the javadoc
 *  comment for the class (this one will not be generated).
 */

Naming:

The convention for naming any variable or method (except for the constructor) is called camel case
 (usually written camelCase). This is because all names should start with a lowercase letter. Any
 new word in the name should start with a capital letter. DO NOT PUT SPACES IN A NAME. YOUR COMPILER
 WILL YELL AT YOU.

Do:
thisIsADecentVariableName - this is generally what you should use (though it doesn't need to be this long)
THISISACONSTANT - this is only used for values that are declared final (constant)
_thisIsAVariableName - I've only seen this used in languages like C or C++ (not recommended)

Don't:
this is not a variable name - you're compiler will yell at you for this
this_is_not_a_good_variable_name - while there are cases that this is acceptable, for the most part it isn't
ThisIsNotAGoodVariableName - do not start a variable or method name with a capital letter

Also, all variable/class/interface names should be mnemonic, meaning that you should be able to
 look at the variable name and tell what it is being used for. They don't have to be long necessarily,
 but you shouldn't have to guess at all. It should be really obvious.

Here's an example if you were adding up values from an array. You would cycle through the array,
 indexing each value, and adding them to the total.

Do use:

sum - for the total
index - for the current index that you are at in the array
tempValue - for the value at each index in the array

Don't use:

x
y
z
i
j
k
r
c

One-letter names are only really okay if you're just running through a loop or something,
 but you should still try to avoid it if you can. Don't ever use these for a class variable
 or parameter. You will spend far more time debugging than you should have to if the name doesn't
 give you some sort of clue as to what it's being used for.


/* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- */


Declarations:

In Java, every class, class variable, and method (function) has a declaration.
 This declaration generally has a group of modifiers before the actual name. First, I'm going to give
 you the general format for declaring a class, variable, or method. Later, I'll go over what the
 individual pieces of the declaration mean.


METHODS

The general format for a method:

<access modifier> <static or non-static> <abstract?> <final?> <return type> <method name>(<any parameters>)

Here are some examples of what a normal method would look like:

public void talk()
private static int getNumber()
public final void setNumber(final int number)

These are all valid method declarations.

NOTE: Constructors are also considered methods, but they are a bit more specific, and their format
        is a bit different. The only have an access modifier, and the name must be the same as the
        class.

        <access modifier> ClassName(<any parameters>)

        SIDE NOTE: A constructor with no parameters is called a default constructor. It is generally
                    advised to make a default constructor even if you're not sure whether or not you
                    would need to use it.


CLASSES

The general format for a class:

<access modifier> <static?> <abstract?> <final?> class ClassName

Here are some examples of what a normal class would look like:

public final class SomeClass
private static class SomeInternalClass
public abstract class SomeAbstractClass

I will explain more about the modifiers in a bit, but real quick I want to make two notes:

1) Static is only used for a private, internal class. You would never use static on a normal class.
2) A class cannot be both abstract and final. Abstract means that the class isn't fully implemented
    and requires a subclass, while final (in this case) means that you cannot make a subclass from
    this class. As you might guess, those don't work well together.

   2.1) Static and abstract are only ever used together for an internal class, never for a variable or method.

   2.2) Static and final are only ever used together for a variable or internal class, never for a method.


If a class is inheriting from another class, it would look like this:

public class SomeClass extends SomeParentClass


If a class is implementing an interface, it would look like this:

public class SomeClass implements SomeInterface


If a class both extends another class and implements an interface, the extension would come
 first, followed by the interface. Also, a class may only extend from ONE other class in Java,
 but it can implement multiple interfaces. Example:

 public class SomeClass extends SomeParentClass implements SomeInterface, SomeOtherInterface


VARIABLES

The general format for a variable:

<access modifier> <static?> <final?> <data type> <variable name>


Here are some examples of a normal variable:

private int value
public static final int MYINT


All class variables should generally be made private. If a variable is public, then it is what we
 call a global variable. THESE ARE VERY BAD. We don't want global variables floating around everywhere
 that everyone has access to and can change. Now, that being said, while a variable should generally
 always be made private, we will usually make two methods for it called a getter and a setter. As the
 names suggest, one method "gets" the variable and the other "sets" it to the desired value. There are
 multiple reasons why it's preferred to access a variable through its getters and setters instead of
 directly, and I'm not going to go into them here. Suffice to say, it can cause problems if you don't
 use the getters and setters. Plus, often times we won't want to make a setter. We might want someone
 to be able to access and use the variable, but not change its value.

 The alternative to making a getter would be to make a global constant. This is different from a
 normal global variable because the value of it is constant, meaning that no one can change it. To
 make something a global constant, you would make it both public and final.


/* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- */


Modifiers:

Modifiers are how we classify things. I will walk through the groups that I mentioned above in the
 declarations section. Just to note, there are more than what I've mentioned, but are dependent on
 the type of program you're writing. Since they're not commonly used, I went ahead and just left them
 out of this.


<Access Modifiers>

Access modifiers determine who has access to the given class/variable/method. There are 4 different
 access modifiers: private, protected, no modifier (package-private), and public:

 Private - This means that the item it modifies can only be accessed within the class that
            it was declared in.

 Protected - This means that the item it modifies can only be accessed within either the
                class that it was declared in, or any subclasses of the class it was declared in.

 No modifier - This is also commonly called package-private. It means that the item it modifies can
                be accessed within the package that the class it's declared in is in. In other words,
                only a class that's in the same package (folder) can access it.

 Public - This means that the item it modifies can be accessed by anyone


<Static?>

Static is often a very misunderstood modifier. To put it simply, static means that the item it
 modifies is tied directly to the class it's declared in. If an item is non-static, then that means
 that it's tied to an instance of the class it's declared in.

Here's an example:

Let's say that I have the following example class:

public class ExampleClass {

    private static int staticValue = 5;

    private int instanceValue;

    public ExampleClass(int someValue) {
        instanceValue = someValue
    }

    public static int getStaticValue() {
        return staticValue;
    }

    public int getInstanceValue() {
        return instanceValue;
    }
}

Now let's say I create some instances of this class and print out their values:

ExampleClass example1 = new ExampleClass(1);

System.out.println("Static value = " + ExampleClass.getStaticValue());
System.out.println("Instance value = " + example1.getInstanceValue());

ExampleClass example2 = new ExampleClass(2);

System.out.println("Static value = " + ExampleClass.getStaticValue());
System.out.println("Instance value = " + example2.getInstanceValue());

The output would be:

Static value = 5
Instance value = 1
Static value = 5
Instance value = 2

As you can see, the static value isn't changing no matter what I set the instance value to. Also,
 notice how I'm accessing the values. To get the instance values, I reference the specific instance
 that I created. However, to get the static value, I always reference the class. This is what I mean
 by something that is static being tied to the class and not an instance. If you tried to do the either
 of the following, you would get an error:

 1) example1.getStaticValue()

 2) ExampleClass.getInstanceValue()

#1 this will work, but it will throw a warning because you're trying to reference something that is
    static via an instance instead of the class

#2 wouldn't work because you're trying to reference in instance value without an instance.


<Abstract?>

As I mentioned above, when something is declared to be abstract, it means that:

    1) If it's a class, it must be extended

    2) If it's a method, it must be overridden

As a rule in Java, you cannot create an instance of an abstract class. This is why abstract classes
 must be extended. We generally use abstract classes when there are common variables and methods that
 we want to use across multiple classes. The reason that we would generally make the class abstract
 is because we want to be able to make a method abstract. Methods cannot be made abstract in a class
 unless the class is abstract. We use abstract methods because what we're saying is, "Any class that
 inherits from me is going to have this method, but I don't know how they're going to implement it,
 so I'm just going to let them tell you." This is why any class that inherits from an abstract class
 must either implement all abstract methods in the parent class, or else must be declared abstract
 as well.


<Final?>

Final means a couple different things depending on the context, so I'm going to list out some
 different items and tell you what the final modifier would do to each of them.

 Class - This class cannot be extended

 Variable - The value of this variable cannot be changed once set

 Method - This method cannot be overridden

 Parameter - The value of this parameter cannot be changed


<Return type> or <data type>

These are basically the same thing. A return type is used for a method, and a data type it used for
 a variable. Both simply specify the type of something, like Object, int, double, String, etc.

The return type for a method is the type of object that it will return. Another common return type
 is void, which means that the method will not return anything. It will just do something and then
 quit.


/* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- */


Curly brackets:

There are a couple conventions when it comes to the usage of curly brackets. Generally there are two
 common ways that people use them, shown below:


 public void blankMethod() {
    //This is the way that I prefer
 }

 public void otherBlankMethod()
 {
    //This is how some people like to do it
 }

Either way is acceptable. It just comes down to personal preference. However, make sure that you are
 consistent. Don't change how you use them, and make sure that if you're working in a group,
 that everyone is doing it the same way. It will make the code easier to follow.

Also, MAKE SURE YOU INDENT! The actual amount of indentation is up for debate, but what isn't is that
 you need to do it. It makes code way harder to read and debug if there isn't proper indentation.
 There are a lot of errors that are caused because people thought that something was a part of some
 loop or if-statement and it wasn't, or vice versa. Proper indentation is the best way to avoid these
 logic errors.

Also, final note on this: There are times when you can avoid using curly brackets. If you write
 something like a while-loop, or a for-loop, or an if-statement, and the body only has one line,
 then you don't need to use them. However, if the body is more than one line, they are required.

Here's an example of not needing curly brackets:

if(true)
    System.out.println("TRUE");
else
    System.out.println("FALSE");


Here's an example of needing brackets:

if(true) {
    int x = Math.pow(2, 5);              //x = 2^5
    System.out.println("x = " + x);      //x = 32
}
else
    System.out.println("You'll never get here");


The exception to this is any method or constructor. Even if their body is only one line, methods
 and constructors must always have brackets

/* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- */

Bracket types:

These are the types of brackets and how to refer to them.

Curly brackets - {}

Angle brackets - <>

Parentheses - ()

Square brackets - []


/* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- */

Errors:

This specific section will deal with more than just Java. What I'm going to discuss here can be seen
 in any programming language. Obviously, errors occur everywhere, but I'm going to be talking about
 two specific kinds of errors: syntax and logic

SYNTAX

Syntax errors are the nice ones. I say this because they are the ones that you don't have to worry
 about catching. These are things that the compiler catches for you. Another term for a syntax error
 would be a compile-time error. We like it when these are the problem because not only are they easy
 to see, but depending on the IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that you're using, you will
 even be given suggestions on how to fix the error, some of which can even be done automatically once
 you indicate that that's what you want to do.


LOGIC

These are the nightmares of programmers. Logic errors are the ones that every programmer prays that
 they don't have. Why? Because you won't see it coming. Logic errors, a.k.a. run-time errors, as the
 name suggests, are only caught at run-time. They are not something that your compiler will catch for
 you. Your program will be working just fine, and then all of a sudden something will happen and the
 whole thing will just stop working. This is usually do to a logic error.

There are ways to prevent logic errors, but none of them are fool-proof or catch-all. And none of them
 are all that simple to do. The two biggest things that you can do to prevent logic errors are:

 1) Design your system well - some things can be caught in the design phase because you will be able
                                to see that it doesn't work the way that you were thinking based on
                                how things are supposed to work together

 2) Test any and all code that you write as much as you can - I will go over this in the next section


/* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- */


Testing:

There are 3 major types of tests that are generally categorized based on the amount of code involved
 in the testing. The 3 types are as follows:

 1) Unit (smallest)

 2) Integration

 3) UI (largest)

Unit tests are tests that only deal with one particular thing, like a class or even just a specific
 function. They are meant to test the corner cases for the class/function. A corner case is basically
 something that may or may not be likely to happen, but if it did happen then it could potentially
 break the whole program. For example, what if I needed the user to provide some input for a function
 that I wanted to use. I would want to test using that function with multiple cases of user input to
 make sure that the function would properly do what I intend. Often times, it is a good idea to limit
 the amount or type of user input to ensure that it will work as intended.

Integration testing is a bit more in-depth. Integration testing involves testing how multiple classes
 will work together and communicate. If you're programming on a system, these tests can also be done
 on the system to make sure that things will work on the system as expected. However, these tests are
 still relatively small. They aren't meant to do a bunch of different things. They're only for
 checking minimal usage on the system.

UI tests are the largest tests. These tests are designed to see how the overall system will work.
 These are the kinds of tests that would be tested by an actual user to make sure that everything
 works according to the user's input and direction.


In general, because unit tests are rather small comparatively, there should be a lot of them. If we
 can verify that the functionality of a class is good, then we know that an error in the system
 wouldn't be caused by that class. On the flip side, because UI tests attempt to test the system as
 a whole, there are usually only a few of them because they are extremely difficult to write and are
 rather big.
